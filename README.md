Maternal Risk Assessment using XGBoost Classifier

This project involves using machine learning to assess maternal health risks based on factors such as age, blood pressure, blood sugar levels, body temperature, and heart rate. The model is built using XGBoost Classifier to predict maternal risk levels: low risk, mid risk, and high risk.
